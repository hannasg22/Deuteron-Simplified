"""This module will contain the potential used to solve our equations.

Parameters needed in the potentials:
    r0 : r value for the range of the square well potential (dimensions: fm)
    V_C0 : depth of the potential (dimensions: MeV)
These values have been chosen due to experimental data.

For further information check README.md section.

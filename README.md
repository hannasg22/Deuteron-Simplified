# Simplified model for the deuteron

## Goal of the code

Bfriefly explained, this code is provided to solve specifically the most simplified case of the deuteron equation(s) and get its eigenfunction and eigenvalue.

In order to find the results, a specific model for the potential is implemented. But another option could be applied, making use of the user's preferred election.
